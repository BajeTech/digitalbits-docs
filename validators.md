DigitalBits.io doesn't currently run a validator. We do run a couple nodes recording and saving network history.

If you would like to run a validator please:
 <!-- - Read the [admin guide](https://developer.digitalbits.io/digitalbits-core/learn/admin.html). -->
 <!-- - Join the #validators channel on [our slack](http://slack.digitalbits.io). -->
 - See the [example config](./other/digitalbits-core-validator-example.cfg) for setting up your validator.
 - Start your node.
 - Open a pull request to list it here.

<!-- For general validator support, please check out [the digitalbits-public #validator channel.](https://slack.digitalbits.io) -->

<!-- ## None of the following validators are recommended by DigitalBits Foundation. -->

<!-- We don't know who really controls these nodes. They could all be owned by the same person! This list is purely for informational purposes. -->
