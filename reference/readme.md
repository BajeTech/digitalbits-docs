title: Frontier Reference Overview
---
Frontier is the client-facing API server for the DigitalBits ecosystem.  It acts as the interface between [DigitalBits Core](https://github.com/xdbfoundation) and applications that want to access the DigitalBits network. Frontier allows you to submit transactions to the network, check the status of accounts, and subscribe to event streams. For more details, see an [overview of the DigitalBits network](https://developer.digitalbits.io/guides/).

You can interact directly with Frontier via cURL or a web browser. Digitalbits.io also provides a [JavaScript SDK](https://developer.digitalbits.io/js-digitalbits-sdk/reference/) for clients to use to interact with Frontier.

Digitalbits.io runs an [instance of Frontier](https://frontier.testnet.digitalbits.io/) that is connected to the testnet.
