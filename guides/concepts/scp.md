title: DigitalBits Consensus Protocol
---

The DigitalBits Consensus Protocol (DCP) provides a way to reach consensus without relying on a closed system to accurately record financial transactions. DCP has a set of provable safety properties that optimize for safety over livenessâ€”in the event of partition or misbehaving nodes, it halts progress of the network until consensus can be reached. DCP simultaneously enjoys four key properties: decentralized control, low latency, flexible trust, and asymptotic security.  DCP is a fork of the DigitalBits Consensus Protocol. To learn all about that protocol, read their [white paper](https://www.stellar.org/papers/stellar-consensus-protocol).
