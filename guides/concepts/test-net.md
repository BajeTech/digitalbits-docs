title: Testnet
---

The testnet is a small test DigitalBits network, open to developers.

digitalbits.io runs 3 digitalbits-core validators on this test network. Set your digitalbits-core to connect to us by using this [configuration](https://github.com/xdbfoundation/DigitalBits/blob/7f8dc82b3f29bed4d3f386a272fb4933b045c97e/docs/digitalbits-core_testnet.cfg). You can also find a [Frontier instance](https://frontier.testnet.digitalbits.io/) that is connected to the testnet.

The testnet is for, well, testing. It's occasionally reset, so don't get attached to any balances or accounts that you have on it.
